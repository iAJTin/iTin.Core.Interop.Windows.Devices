# NativeMethods.EnumDisplayDevices method

Get information about the display devices in the current session. For more information, please see http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/dd162609.aspx.

```csharp
public static bool EnumDisplayDevices(string lpDevice, uint iDevNum, 
    out DISPLAY_DEVICE lpDisplayDevice, uint dwFlags)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| lpDevice | Pointer to the device name. If it is null, it returns the information of all the video adapters on the device. To obtain the information of each adapter we must increase the value of the `iDevNum` parameter. |
| iDevNum | Index that specifies the display device. The operating system identifies each display device with an index. These indexes are consecutive integers, from 0. If the current session has three display devices, for example, the index values 0, 1 and 2 are specified respectively. |
| lpDisplayDevice | Pointer to a structure [`DISPLAY_DEVICE`](../DISPLAY_DEVICE.md) that receives the information from the display device specified by iDevNum. Before calling this function, the cb member of the structure must be initialized with the size of the structure in bytes. |
| dwFlags | Set this indicator to EDD_GET_DEVICE_INTERFACE_NAME (0x00000001) to retrieve the device interface name of GUID_DEVINTERFACE_MONITOR, which is registered by the base operating system by monitor. The value is placed in the DeviceID member of the [`DISPLAY_DEVICE`](../DISPLAY_DEVICE.md) structure in `lpDisplayDevice`. |
