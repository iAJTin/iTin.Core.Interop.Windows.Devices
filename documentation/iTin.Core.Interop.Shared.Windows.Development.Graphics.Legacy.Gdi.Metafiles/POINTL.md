| [X](POINTL/X.md) | X coordinate of the point. |
| [Y](POINTL/Y.md) | Y coordinate of the point. |
| override [Equals](POINTL/Equals.md)(…) | Returns a value that indicates whether this object is equal to another. |
| [Equals](POINTL/Equals.md)(…) | Indicates whether the current object is the same as another object of the same type. |
| override [GetHashCode](POINTL/GetHashCode.md)() | Returns the hash code of this structure. |
| override [ToString](POINTL/ToString.md)() | Returns a string that represents the current [`POINTL`](./POINTL.md) object. |
| [operator ==](POINTL/op_Equality.md) | Implement the equality operator (==). |
| [implicit operator](POINTL/op_Implicit.md) | Make an implicit conversion from type [`POINTL`](./POINTL.md) to type Point. (2 operators) |
